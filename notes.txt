# Overview of Decommissioning

.pull-left[
* Total estimated cost £48 billion (OGA 2020 [1])
* Cost is ~10% total annual expenditure of UK oil&gas industry [2]
* Industry pays full cost, claims tax relief (est. £16 billion [2])
* Pipelines and subsea infrastructure account for 10% of decommissioning cost [1]
* ~6000km pipelines to be decommissioned over next 10 years in UKCS
* options for pipelines: abandon in place; full/partial removal; or re-use
  * most subsea pipelines will be "abandoned" in place after decommissioning

# Digital twins

* Digitial twin technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and common
  * realistic 3-D visualisations combined with physical modelling
  * provide a physically realistic and intutive indiction of the current state of a system
  * potential for predicting future system states 

* Currently most of the models used in digital twins are based on engineering theory

# Objectives of this talk

* Review regulations and expectations relating to pipeline decommissioning
  * focus on UKCS
* Look at options and reasons for choosing options
* Discuss the role of data and digital technology
* Propose that preserving pipeline data now will help ensure sustainability post-decommissioning for pipelines left in-situ

# Overview of decommissioning

* Total cost of decommissioning £48 billion (OGA 2020 est. [1])

--
* Decommissioning cost is ~10% total annual expenditure of UK oil & gas industry [2]

--
* Industry pays full cost, claims tax relief (est. £16 billion [2])

--
* Pipelines and subsea infrastructure account for 10% of decommissioning cost [1]

--
* ~6000km pipelines to be decommissioned over next 10 years in UKCS

--
* options for pipelines: abandon in place; full/partial removal; or re-use

--
  * most subsea pipelines will be “abandoned” in place after decommissioning

# Considerations for strategy

* Cost  

--
* Cost to taxpayers  

--
* Technical feasibility  

--
* Environmental issues  
  * wildlife habitats  

--
* Sustainability issues  

--
* Other uses of the sea and seabed  

--
* Re-use of assets

# BEIS guidance notes - general approach

(paraphrased extracts from BEIS guidance notes [3])

* robustly assess decommissioning options based on evidence and data (10.2)  
  * all feasible decommissioning options should be considered (10.5)  

---
* must aim to achieve a clear seabed (11.1/ANNEX H)  

--
* the potential for reuse of the pipeline should be considered before decommissioning (10.5)

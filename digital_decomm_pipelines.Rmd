# Objectives of this talk

* Review regulations and expectations relating to pipeline decommissioning
  * focus on UKCS
* Look at options and reasons for choosing options
* Discuss the role of data and digital technology
* Propose that preserving pipeline data now will help ensure sustainability post-decommissioning for pipelines left in-situ

# Overview of decommissioning

* Total cost of decommissioning £48 billion (OGA 2020 est. [1])

--
* Decommissioning cost is ~10% total annual expenditure of UK oil & gas industry [2]

--
* Industry pays full cost, claims tax relief (est. £16 billion [2])

--
* Pipelines and subsea infrastructure account for 10% of decommissioning cost [1]

--
* ~6000km pipelines to be decommissioned over next 10 years in UKCS

--
* options for pipelines: abandon in place; full/partial removal; or re-use

--
  * most subsea pipelines will be “abandoned” in place after decommissioning

# BEIS Guidance Notes 

<span><small>(Paraphrased extracts from 2018 BEIS Guidance Notes [4], section numbers noted)</small></span>

* Robustly assess decommissioning options based on evidence and data (10.2)  

--
* Must aim to achieve a clear seabed (11.1/ANNEX H)  

--
* Potential for reuse of the pipeline should be considered before decommissioning (10.5)  

--
* Small diameter pipelines are expected to be entirely removed (10.18)

--
* The following pipelines may be candidates for in-situ decommissioning (10.12):  
  * those which are adequately buried and trenched ... expected that burial minimum depth of 0.6m will be necessary  
  * pipelines which are not trenched or buried ... are candidates for leaving in place if the comparative assessment shows that to be the preferred option in particular trunk lines (10.12) 
  * in addition to cleaning pipelines to remove hydrocarbons, reasonable endeavours to remove wax and other contaminants (10.7)

--
* Mattresses, grout bags, or contained rock deposits should be considered for removal with the aim to achieve a clear seabed (11.1)
  * recognised that removal of rock-dump is unlikely to be practicable and it is generally assumed that the rock-dump and the pipeline will remain in place (10.19)  

???
1. all feasible decommissioning options should be considered (10.5)  
1. removal of the rock-dump is unlikely to be practicable and it is generally assumed that the rock-dump and the pipeline will remain in place
1. Small diameter pipelines, including flexible flowlines and umbilicals are expected to be entirely removed

# Survey, Monitoring, Data

<span><small>(Paraphrased extracts from 2018 BEIS Guidance Notes [4], section numbers noted)</small></span>

* Upon completion of decommissioning, surveys should be undertaken to identify and recover any debris or obstructions on the seabed (12.38)

--
* Pipelines and stabilisation features left in place will be subject to a risk based monitoring regime (15.4)  
  * areas where deposits have not been removed will be subject to monitoring requirements post decommissioning (11.6)  

--
* Pipelines decommissioned in place should be supported by a study which addresses the degree of past and future burial/exposure of the pipeline (10.11)  
  * study should include the survey history of the line with appropriate data    

--
* Geotechnical data collected under the petroleum licence should be placed in the [National Hydrocarbons Data Archive](http://www.bgs.ac.uk/nhda/) (14.5)  

--
* Intention is that companies will make provision for keeping the most historically important records in the [Oil and Gas Archive](https://www.capturing-the-energy.org.uk/research/oilgasarchive/) (19.3)

???

1. Pipeline decommissioned in place, then the programme should be supported by a suitable study which
addresses the degree of past and likely future burial/exposure of the pipeline 
and any potential effect on the marine environment and other uses of the sea. 
1. The study should
include the survey history of the line with appropriate data to confirm the current status of
the line including the extent and depth of burial, trenching, spanning and exposure. It
should also detail levels of fishing activity in the area.

# Liabilities and Legacies

<span><small>(Paraphrased extracts from 2018 BEIS Guidance Notes [4], section numbers noted)</small></span>

* Residual liability remains with the owners in perpetuity (17.2)  

--
* Persons/parties who own an installation or pipeline at the time of its decommissioning will remain the owners of any residues and remains after decommissioning (17.1)  

--
* Measures to manage the potential risks arising from any legacies should be addressed in the decommissioning programme (17.6)  

--
* Remedial activity (including removal of the pipeline) may be required if issues arise (10.21)  

---

# Large Diameter Pipelines

* Pipelines Do>16" are typically "surface laid" (lying exposed on seabed and not trenched) in UKCS

* Technology for removal is not well developed
  * reverse S-lay 
  * cut-in-place and recover sections

* Trenching and burial would be technically difficult and costly

* Rock-dumping all UKCS surface laid pipelines would require minimum 74 million tonnes rock (estimated, Rouse et al. [6])


???

### Large Diameter Pipelines a challenge


---

# Pipeline Re-use

* Re-use for hydrocarbon transport/storage
* H<sub>2</sub> export of offshore generated "green" hydrogen (Ounnas [7]) 
* CO<sub>2</sub> transport as part of CCS
* Full documentation and data packages will be required to qualify a pipeline for re-use
* Historical survey data will be crucial for determining the fatigue damage sustained by the pipeline and the remaining lifetime  
* Even with re-use, still must plan for ultimate decommissioning  

---

# The Role of Data

* The oil&gas industry is sitting on a huge amount of subsea pipeline survey data, and doing little or nothing with it  
  * there is a risk that all this data will be lost after decommissioning
* «fear of data» still pervades the industry
  * something-could-happen if data is released
  * unable see the benefits of sharing data
* The benefits to the industry of sharing data have been pointed out may times [10]
  * reduce risk
  * enable new technologies, (e.g. "digital twins" ) 
  * create new business opportunities
* Examples of reservoir and exploration data being openly shared
  * Equinor’s Volve reservoir datasets
  * OGA National Data Repository
* Collating and sharing environmental data has major benefits for decommissioning (Murray et al. [9])

# Conclusions

* Pipeline decommissioning is still a developing field
* Abandonment in place is currently the preferred option for most subsea pipelines
* Pipeline related data should be secured for the future as part of the decommissioning process
* The decommissioning process in the UKCS is well developed and robust
